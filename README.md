# Library Management System

## Description

This Library Management System is a simple application built using JavaFX, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Developed with IntelliJ IDEA and Scene Builder, this system efficiently manages library resources and operations through an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, update, and delete book records.
- **Patron Management**: Manage library patrons, including adding, updating, and deleting patron records.
- **Transaction Management**: Handle book issuing and returns.
- **User Interface**: Utilize JavaFX for a responsive and interactive UI.

## Implementation Details

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **Classes and Objects**: Defined classes for books, patrons, book issues, book returns, and other relevant entities.
- **Inheritance**: Implemented an inheritance hierarchy to represent different types of library resources.
- **Polymorphism**: Utilized polymorphism to support various library operations and behaviors.

### Data Structures Implementation

- **Linked Lists**: Implemented linked lists for efficiently managing book lists and patron records.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Used stacks and queues for managing transactions and the issuing processes.

### Database Design and SQL Skills

- **Database Schema**: Designed the library database schema using a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- **Normalization**: Normalized the database schema to the third normal form (3NF) to minimize data redundancy and ensure data consistency.
- **SQL Queries**: Wrote SQL queries for creating database tables, inserting, updating, and deleting records, and querying information.

### JDBC Utilization

- **Database Connection**: Established a JDBC connection to the library database and managed database connections efficiently.
- **SQL Execution**: Used JDBC to execute SQL statements, including prepared statements and callable statements.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling and exception management strategies to ensure robustness and reliability.
